**For Event Tracking App**

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal was to develop an event tracking application that allowed the user to login with predetermined credentials, send SMS messages for forgotten passwords, and add events to a database in real time. 
This app was developed to address the user's need to organize their schedule or series of events. It is meant to function similarly to a calendar app by sending push notifications to the user when an event is approaching

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app needed a login screen for the user to enter login credentials, a home screen displaying a database of events organized by day, and a screen for when the user wants to add a new event to the database.
This screen lets the user enter a name and date for the event, and edit it as well. My design kept the user in mind by maintaining a clean interface that focused on one functiuon per page. It does not take anymore than 3 clicks to navgate anywhere on the applicaiton. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached the development process by first establishing the user needs. Some were identified in the assignment rubric, and the rest I created from user interviews and personas. Once I established these needs, I created the framework of XML files and java classes and slowly added specific functionality from there. This technique was effective because it allowed me to continuously test my application as I added new pieces to it. This process can be applied in the future through sprint cycles. It can be done in future course projects or in the real world. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I employed good practice by testing my code incrementally after I added each new block. If the app runs with no errors, then the code is working properly. If an error occurs, then I know that it has something to do with my most recently added code block, and I can troubleshoot the issue without having to review every single line of code. This process is important because it is how developers test their code in the real world. Sprint cycles are fast and developers do not have time to review every single line of code. This process helps them identify where erros may occur and keep work bug free.  

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate in my initial developemtn of the XML files for this app. My original plan was to have a final design in place before I started testing the app. I realized that this was costing me time due to having to go back to the XML files everytime I wanted to change functionality in the code. I spent more time testing different layouts and seeing how well they worked with the rest of the apps functionality. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was successful in demonstrating the login process for my application. Letting the user enter information, btu also request an SMS message if they forgot their login information is crucial for any application's data security. Impprting the proper modules makes it quick and easy to add this functionality to any applicaiton and will make it much safer for users in the long run.
